# MASAI - STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

- Create an admin panel where admin can add new students to the database. Accept name, city, age, education, gender, contact and add it to students collection.

- In the admin panel ( webpage ) itself, admin should be able to see all the students added to database,

- Admin can remove students from webpage itself. The student should be removed from database as well.

- Admin should be able to sort the students by name and age.

- Implement google auth for admin access. If email address contains .masaischool.com, then only complete authentication. Think of how can you make it more secure.

- On main page ( this is something that users can see, admin panel is accessible to admin only ), show the list of available contests for next 7 days.

- Contests will have title, type ( DSA or Coding ), deadline, tags, time etc. Create filters so that students can see only DSA or coding contests. Sort contests by deadilne as well.

- 1 . Implement pagination. Show 5 contests at a time.

- Admin can also add contests using a form from admin panel.

- Create appropriate API's to get the list of all students and contests.

- Follow MVC Architecture
